# Bicing API

The goal of this API is to ease customer's usage of large-scale public bicycle sharing system.

By collecting data from different providers (Bicing, Velib, ...) it can advice customers or provide them useful information (best time of picking up a bike, ...)

This API has been implemented in [DDD][wiki-DDD] with [PHP 7.1][PHP], [Symfony 4.0][symfony] and a [Timescale database][timescale].

## Support

Code and folder structure follow Domain Driven Design (DDD).
Here is a good article to understand naming and folder [Domain Driver Design, little explanation and example](https://jorgearco.com/ddd-with-symfony/).

### The folder structure

    src
        \
            |\ Application     `Contains the Use Cases and the Processes of the domain system, commands, handlers and subscribers`
            |
            |\ Domain          `The system business logic layer (Models, Events, Exceptions...)`
            |
            |\ Infrastructure  `Its the implementation of the system outside the model. I.E: Persistence, Query, etc`
            |
            |\ UserInterface   `It contains all the interfaces allowed for a user of the API (Cli, HTTP, Rest, etc)`
